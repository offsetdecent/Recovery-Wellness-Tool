# Recovery-Wellness-Tool

This is going to start as a website and turn into a phone app one day.
What I want for this tool:
-the fundamentals of Alcoholics Anonymous. The 12 and 12 and references to all reading material on recovery tools to use. Leave out the history for advanced settings for another project. (a service work app with scheduling and phone dialer like for this app but to call your service sponser)
-b day counter with min seconds days months years of sobriety. with a share my b day on a socials or with someone so they can show off their sober counter. It should have great images that remind you of recovery.
-There should be a virtual coin they get for their b day.
like a secret badge or coin they can unlock or pops up as an alert on their b day
-phone list they can edit and use thier phone with. where they can store their sponsers contact info. they can create a phone list where they can only call people the same sex as them. ( an alert box will warn them they cannot have a sponser that is a different sex than them. It will not save numbers that are from the same sex in thier recovery tool. If they want opposite sex phone numbers they will have to chance that shit on their own phone not in the recovery tool.)
-There will be a live updated list of meetings near you with a map on how to get there. There will be a zoom meeting list or any meetings online as well.
-There will be a 90 meetings in 90 Days. section where they can get their slip signed or app marked off. 
- It will have the daily reflections pop up the first time you open it for the day. or a section for it i don't know yet or a link to it online.
- I want to have a birthday alert pop up when it is one of their recovery buddies AA b day.
